# Escalation Process for Incident Management

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the escalation process for handling incidents, ensuring a structured and timely resolution while maintaining accountability at each level.

## 2. Scope
This process applies to all operational teams handling incidents that require escalation due to severity, impact, or resolution delays.

## 3. Escalation Levels & Responsible Personnel

| Escalation Level | Criteria | Responsible Personnel | Timeframe |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Level 1** | Initial issue identified; can be resolved within the standard response window. | Support Team | 0-2 hours |
| **Level 2** | Issue not resolved at Level 1; requires technical intervention. | Team Lead | 2-4 hours |
| **Level 3** | High impact issue affecting multiple users/systems. | CTO/CEO | 4-8 hours |
| **Level 4** | Critical issue impacting business continuity or compliance. | CTO/CEO | Immediate |

## 4. Escalation Process Flow
1. Incident is reported through the designated channel (ticketing system, email, or phone).
2. Support Team reviews and attempts resolution (Level 1).
3. If unresolved within 2 hours, the incident is escalated to the Team Lead (Level 2).
4. If unresolved within 4 hours, the CTO/CEO is informed (Level 3).
5. If unresolved within 8 hours or deemed critical, the CTO/CEO takes immediate action (Level 4).
6. The incident is reviewed, mitigation actions are taken, and a resolution plan is communicated to stakeholders.
7. A post-mortem is conducted if the issue required Level 3 or Level 4 escalation.
